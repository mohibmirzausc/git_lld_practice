# 🍔 Food Delivery System LLD - Complete Notes

## 📋 Project Overview
**System**: Food delivery platform (UberEats/DoorDash clone)  
**Focus**: Clean architecture, design patterns, scalable OOP design  
**Rating**: 7.5/10 (interview-ready foundation)

---

## ✅ What I Built

### Core Architecture
- **Entities**: User, Restaurant, Order, Service
- **Inheritance**: Abstract User → Customer/Driver
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints + enums
- **Modularity**: Separated files by domain

### Design Patterns Used
- **Builder Pattern**: Restaurant & Order creation
- **Singleton**: Service coordination
- **Abstract Base Classes**: User hierarchy
- **Factory Method**: User type creation

### Business Logic
- Order flow: Accepted → Preparing → Ready → Picked Up
- Menu management with dynamic pricing
- User role separation (Customer vs Driver)
- Basic notification infrastructure

## 🎯 Key Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Complex Object Creation
**Problem**: Orders/restaurants need validation + multiple properties  
**Solution**: Builder Pattern
```python
order = OrderBuilder()
    .set_customer(customer)
    .set_restaurant(restaurant) 
    .order_item("pizza", 2)
    .build()
```

### 2. Payment Integration
**Problem**: Where to put payment without breaking SRP?  
**Solution**: Service Layer Orchestration
- Order = pure data model
- Service = handles payment coordination
- Maintains loose coupling

### 3. State Management
**Problem**: Multiple status types (restaurant vs delivery)  
**Solution**: Separated status enums
- `OrderStatus` for restaurant ops
- `DeliveryStatus` for driver ops
- Service coordinates transitions

### 4. Scalability Design
**Problem**: Structure for future features without over-engineering  
**Solution**: Modular architecture + dependency injection
- Single responsibility per component
- Easy feature additions
- Component swapping capability

## 💡 Technical Insights

### Design Pattern Selection
- **Builder**: Perfect for optional params + validation
- **Singleton**: Good for service coordination (watch testing)
- **Abstract Classes**: Better than interfaces with shared code

### Domain Modeling
- **Value Objects**: Price, enums prevent primitive obsession
- **Entity Relationships**: Clear ownership chains
- **Aggregates**: Order as aggregate root

### Error Handling
- **Boundary Validation**: Validate at construction
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues on errors
- **Clear Messages**: Specific exceptions for debugging

- **Service Layer**: Business logic coordination

### Key Classes
```python
# Core entities
User (ABC) → Customer, Driver
Restaurant (Builder pattern)
Order (Builder pattern)
Service (Singleton)

# Enums
UserType, OrderStatus, DeliveryStatus, DriverStatus
```

### Missing (Next Steps)
